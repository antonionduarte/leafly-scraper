## Data Format

Probably should have classes for:
 - Review 
 - Brand

In which a brand is basically a list of reviews.
A Brand can probably be a collection of reviews 

## Output format 

For single reviews: 
`out/{product_name}`

For brands:
`out/{brand_name}/{product_name}`


## TODO

- [ ] Should probably rework the Data
